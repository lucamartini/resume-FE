    Specifically, I've been working on the development and implementation of:
    < Ul >
      <li> the Morphcast technology running in-browser. It is the main Cynny product. A single-page web app, fully developed in javascript ES2015. The most important third-party JS libraries used to develop it comprehend Webpack for the bundling, Karma+Jasmine for the test-driven development and Vue.js for the UI part.</li>
      <li>Morphcast creator: a desktop app written in C++11 and Qt/QML, to demonstrate the possibility for our customers to create Morphcast videos. It used the Cynny Giotto SDK (see below).</li>
      <li>Cynet: a Chord protocol for a P2P-distributed hash table on the Cynny servers, implemented as a C++ plugin for Node.js, written with libuv and Chrome V8. Its plan was to reliably serve, update and duplicate data, in an environment where many connected nodes could go frequently down. The C++/JS code was written using also CMake, Valgrind (since memory consumption was critical), SQLite for the database management, and Google tests and Mocha (for the unit tests).</li>
      <li>Giotto: an SDK for the Cynny mobile and desktop apps (in C++11). It was the common library all Cynny apps were using to communicate with the Cynny servers. This multithreading synchronization middleware was developed using also third-party libraries like CMake, SQLite (for the synchronized internal database), Djinni (for the interface bindings with Objective-C and Android), and Catch as the testing suite.</li>
